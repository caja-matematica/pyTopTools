* newgen_avgshift_lb40.pkl : 

all (b,d) pairs for *robust* generators with lifespans above 40. The
lower bound (lb) of 40 is irrelevant since we would find the
longest-lived generators anyway -- it allows an initial filter to
lessen file size. Cells currently analyzed:

['new_50125', 'new_40125', 'new_130125', 'new_140125', 'new_110125']

* oldgen_avgshift_lb40.pkl : 

same as above. Cells currently analyzed:

['old_50125', 'old_90125', 'old_100125', 'old_120125']
