Birth times in this folder were computed using *unnormalized* cell images. Each persistence diagram was shifted by the mean pixel value ofthe corresponding frame. The k'th generator 
corresponds to k'th longest lifespan after removing the 'infinite' generator. This differs from the non-V2 figures, which were computed using an ad hoc approach for determining the 
k'th generator. This was fixed for *V2's.
